**COURSE DESCRIPTION**
First developed in the 1960s, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are tools that are widely used for the representation and analysis of geographic data. GIS provides the ability to organize, manipulate, analyze and communicate geographic data that contain the relative geographic information (coordinates) and the associated characteristics (attributes). Nowadays, GIS has become an important analytical tool in urban planning and is becoming more accessible with the rise of open-source software and open data.

The YSS3273 GIS and Demographics course introduces students to the basics of GIS to equip them with the skills to answer spatial questions using QGIS. This  course is renewed from the previous offerings to place an equal emphasis on skill-building and the development of a reflexive practice in using GIS. With the lectures, discussions, and hands-on exercises during lab sessions, students learn how to use GIS for spatial research, being cognizant of the histories and positions that the tools embody. The class covers data handling, projections, data joins, proximity analysis, network analysis, spatial analysis, and offers an introduction to advanced themes of web-based visualization and qualitative GIS. The class is organized into two parts. In the first part of the class, the focus is on skill-building, and in the second part, students develop their first spatial analysis project.
